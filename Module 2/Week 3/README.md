# Week 3
During week 3, we'll work on the first stage of the data life cycle: create & validate. We'll discuss best practices for data sourcing, collection, entry, and validation.

## Lecture 5 – Monday
- Describe the data life cycle (5 min)
- Discuss data sourcing considerations (15 min)
- Explore publicly-available environmental datasets (10 min)
- Write quality metadata (10 min)
- Learn Excel tips for data entry and validation (40 min)

## Lecture 6 – Wednesday
- Learn R functions and tips for quality assurance and quality control (20 min)
- Apply these functions and tips to an oceanographic dataset (60 min)

## Lab 3 – Thursday
- Clean messy data about Monarch butterfly populations (60 min)
- Generate figures and interpret findings (50 min)
