# Lab 3

## Clean messy data about Monarch butterfly populations (90 min)
1) Read about the Western Monarch Count and download the summarized data [here](https://westernmonarchcount.org/data/).
2) Open the downloaded file and go to the "Site Counts by County" tab. Copy cells A1:AO386 and paste the values (right-click > Paste Special... > Values) to a new workbook. Save the new workbook as a comma-separated value (csv) file with an informative title.
3) Open the R Markdown file "Lab 3. Declining Monarch Populations (no code)" and follow the instructions.


## Generate figures and interpret findings (20+ min)
1) After cleaning the data, follow the instructions in the R Markdown file to create summary figures.
2) **Undergraduate students**: Save your file as a PDF or HTML (click Knit in RStudio and troubleshoot as necessary). Turn it in on Canvas.
3) **Graduate students**: Write additional Discussion and References sections in your R Markdown. The Discussion should place your findings or datasets in a broader environmental or scientific context, be between 500-750 words (not including citations), and reference at least 8 primary or secondary research articles. You should incorporate the papers below. Then save your file as a PDF or HTML (click Knit in RStudio and troubleshoot as necessary). Turn it in on Canvas.
