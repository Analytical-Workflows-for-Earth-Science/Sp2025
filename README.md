# Analytical Workflows for Earth Systems Science

Welcome to the course webpage for GEOG 463/563 at Oregon State University! This repository will contain all code templates, data files, and other resources for the course and is linked to our [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/192258322-analytical-workflows-for-earth-science-2025).

## Course Description
Explores data science methods used to gather, validate, organize, analyze, and summarize large amounts of environmental and ecological information. Focuses on developing analytical workflows that are efficient, reproducible, and modular using tools such as the R coding language, RStudio, GitHub, and JupyterLab. Examines case studies including climate change, biodiversity assessments, epidemic modeling, marine spatial planning, and natural resource management.

## Learning Outcomes
Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

1) Design and conduct a research project involving the analysis of big environmental data
2) Apply best practices in data collection, cleaning, wrangling, analysis, and visualization
3) Read and write R code using several packages
4) Implement best practices in scientific programming to promote reproducible research
5) Manage complex research projects using a version control system

In addition, graduate students will be able to:

6) Select and cite relevant research articles
7) Synthesize their findings into a broader environmental context

## Course Modules
The course is organized around four modules that will help undergraduate and graduate students to achieve these learning outcomes:
- [Module 1](https://github.com/Analytical-Workflows-for-Earth-Science/Sp2025/tree/main/Module%201) | Running quantitative and collaborative projects in the earth sciences
- [Module 2](https://github.com/Analytical-Workflows-for-Earth-Science/Sp2025/tree/main/Module%202) | Working with big environmental data
- [Module 3](https://github.com/Analytical-Workflows-for-Earth-Science/Sp2025/tree/main/Module%203) | Analyzing, visualizing, and modeling environmental data
- [Module 4](https://github.com/Analytical-Workflows-for-Earth-Science/Sp2025/tree/main/Module%204) | Completing and evaluating projects
