# Week 2
During week 2 we will start a discussion about doing scientific research in teams, and go over the “digital infrastructure” often used to perform collaborative (code-based) research. We will spend time setting this digital infrastructure up for your term projects.

## Lecture 3 - Monday
- Introduce James (15 mins)
- Discuss how to run collaborative coding projects (5 mins)
- Introduce required digital infrastructure (15 mins)
- Class activity 1: setup digital infrastructure (20 mins)

## Lecture 4 – Wednesday
- Introduce R and Rstudio (15 mins)
- Install R and Rstudio and make sure everyone has it working (15 mins)
- Make a GitHub repository for term project (10 mins)
- Co-write readme with your team. Learn how to push/pull/branches/merge (10 mins)

## Lab 2 – Thursday
- Coding challenge: develop R code to simulate a predator-prey system, involving a for-loop,  involving using ChatGPT as a coding co-pilot, involving making time series figures
- practice using collaborative digital infrastructure (drive, core docs, schedule, meeting, roles and responsibilities, collaborative coding).
- co-developing a GitHub repo
