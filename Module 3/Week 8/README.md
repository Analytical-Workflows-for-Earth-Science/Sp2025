# Week 8

## Lecture 14 – Monday
An introduction to machine learning workflows using the random Forest and ridge regression algorithms as examples. I will cover the types of problems these models can solve, how the algorithms function, and methods for validating machine learning models on environmental data sets. 


## Lecture 15 – Wednesday
Finish the discussion of cross validation methods started on Monday. 
Introduction to artificial neural networks and deep learning.
Introduction to parallel and high performance computing. 

## Lab 8 – Thursdays
Buildiung species distribution models with random forest in R.
