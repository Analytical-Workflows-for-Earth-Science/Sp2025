# Lab 6

## Explore and process data about avian point count surveys from HJ Andrews (60 min)
1) Download the two survey files from GitHub.
2) Download the R Markdown file "Lab 6. Assessing Avian Biodiversity (no code)" and follow the instructions.
3) Make sure to put your data and code in the same folder or use a folder structure like we discussed in lecture.


## Generate figures and interpret findings (50+ min)
1) After processing the data, follow the instructions in the R Markdown file to create visually-appealing figures and answer the research questions.
2) **Undergraduate students**: Save your file as a PDF or HTML (click Knit in RStudio and troubleshoot as necessary). Turn it in on Canvas.
3) **Graduate students**: Write additional Discussion and References sections in your R Markdown. The Discussion should place your findings or datasets in a broader environmental or scientific context, be between 500-750 words (not including citations), and reference at least 8 primary or secondary research articles. You should incorporate the papers below. Then save your file as a PDF or HTML (click Knit in RStudio and troubleshoot as necessary). Turn it in on Canvas.
