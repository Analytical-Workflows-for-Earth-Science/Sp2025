# Week 7
This week we will learn about time series and spatial analysis. We will focus on the fundamental concepts underpinning nonlinear ecosystem dynamics, and explain how we visualize and analyze timeseries data. Additionally, we will be introduced to dimensional reduction techniques for identifying dynamic spatial patterns (in remote sensing and other spatial data).

## Lecture 12 – Monday
Introduction to Vibe Coding with LLMs. Introduction to timeseries analysis. Different kinds of change: trends, heteroskedasticity, non-stationarity, step-functions, episodic shocks, regime shifts, well potentials, attractors.

## Lecture 13 – Wednesday
Non-linear ecosystem dynamics again, hysteresis, early warning signals, critical slowing down, bifurcations. Spatio-temporal data structures, pairwise correlation matrixes (the most beautiful objects in the universe), dimensional reduction using Principal Components Analysis (PCA).

## Lab 7 – Thursday
Map the top three eigenvectors (principal components) of the pairwise correlation matrix for sea surface temperature timeseries measured at multiple locations in the North Pacific. Use an LLM to aid in the analysis.
